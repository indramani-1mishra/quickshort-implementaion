Quick Sort Algorithm Steps:
Choose a Pivot: Select an element from the array to be the "pivot." The choice of pivot can vary (first element, last element, random element, etc.).

Partitioning: Rearrange the array so that elements less than the pivot come before it and elements greater than the pivot come after it. The pivot is then in its correct position.

Recursion: Recursively apply the above steps to the sub-arrays formed by the pivot (elements left of the pivot and elements right of the pivot).

Base Case: The recursion terminates when the sub-array has one or no elements.
